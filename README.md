Web Page Responsiveness and Styling GuidelinesThis: This document outlines the key design and responsiveness guidelines for your web page. Adhering to these instructions will ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience across various devices.1. Responsive Design for Mobile DevicesThe web page must be designed to adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, with a specific focus on mobile devices.Instruction: Implement a responsive design that triggers a "mobile version" layout when the screen width is 480px or less.Implementation Tip: Use CSS Media Queries to apply specific styles for smaller screens. For example:@media (max-width: 480px) {
    /* Styles specific to mobile version */
    .container {
        flex-direction: column; /* Example: Stack elements vertically */
    }
    /* Adjust font sizes, padding, etc., for better mobile usability */
}
2. Link Hover/Active State StylingEnsure a consistent visual feedback when users interact with links.Instruction: When a link is hovered over or becomes active (e.g., clicked), its color should change to #FF6565.Implementation Tip: Apply the following CSS rules:a:hover,
a:active {
    color: #FF6565;
}
3. Button Hover/Active State StylingProvide clear visual cues for button interactions.Instruction: When a button is hovered over or becomes active, its opacity should reduce to 0.9.Implementation Tip: Apply the following CSS rules:button:hover,
button:active {
    opacity: 0.9;
}
4. Content Width and CenteringMaintain a clean and readable layout by controlling the maximum width of your content and centering it on the page.Instruction: The main content area of the web page should have a maximum width of 1000px and be horizontally centered within the page.Implementation Tip: Wrap your main content within a container element (e.g., a div) and apply the following CSS:.content-wrapper {
    max-width: 1000px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    /* Or simply: margin: 0 auto; for top/bottom margins to be zero */
}
By following these instructions, you will create a web page that is both visually appealing and highly functional across various devices.
