# Responsive web development
The objective of the project is to develop a responsive web. The implementation is based solely on HTML and CSS. 
Responsive Design: Adapts beautifully to screens of all sizes, from mobile phones to large desktops. (Specifically optimised for screens <= 480px width for a mobile-first experience).
